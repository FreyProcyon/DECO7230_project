# Prototype 2 - XR Prototype 1
Test Plan IP2
1) Prototype Overview
Project: Rhino/CAD-style XR 3D modeling tool
Operating Environment: Meta Quest (Interaction SDK / Building Blocks)
Interaction Method:
Locomotion: Official Teleport (ground-based Teleport Area)
UI: Poke tappable UI + Quick Actions (not using controller rays)
Modeling Functionality: Create (Cube/Sphere/Cylinder/Plane), Select, Move, Rotate, Scale, Delete (Change Material / PushPull are placeholders)

2) Test Objectives
Evaluate whether users can intuitively understand and complete the basic modeling process:
Create objects and stack them (align with top surfaces)
Select → Move/Rotate/Scale → Delete operations
Evaluate the discoverability and usability of the Poke UI + Quick Actions
Verify whether spatial positioning in Teleport affects task completion (not a comparison, only to confirm usability)

3) Validation Metrics
Task Completion Rate: ≥ 80% of participants completed both tasks as required.
Time thresholds:
Task 1 (Create + Stack + Scale): ≤ 60 seconds
Task 2 (Transform + Delete): ≤ 60 seconds
Discoverability: ≥ 70% of participants were able to find and use the Quick Actions/top Delete panel without verbal prompts.
Subjective ratings (5-point scale, collected verbally):
Poke UI Usability ≥ 3.5/5
Teleport Comfort ≥ 3.5/5

4) Methodology
Think-Aloud (Thinking while performing)
Task-Based (Two clear tasks, timed)
Light subjective feedback (2–3 verbal sentences + 1–2 5-point ratings after the test)

5) Data Collection (Screen Recording Only)
Screen Recording: Record the entire process (including hand/controller pointing, UI) using a Quest/PC screen recorder (or a mobile phone screen capture). (Operation)
Timestamps: Record the start/end time of the task when reviewing the screen recording (no need for pen and paper, just write directly on the video timeline)
Verbal Key Points: Within 30 seconds after the test, have the participant provide 2–3 sentences of overall experience and two 5-point ratings (oralized for on-screen/audio integration)

6) Test Setup
Scene Includes:
Teleport Area Floor (teleportable)
Toolbar (World Space) + Quick Actions (Poke)
Create/Select/Transform/Delete (XR integrated (Trigger/Thumbstick)
Device: MetaQuest + controller; screen recording solution ready
Participants: Classmates/instructor, target approximately 5 people (can vary slightly)

7) Test Process (total ~5 minutes/person)
Instruction (30 seconds)
"This is an XR 3D modeled prototype. You can use Teleport to move around and use your right hand to poke." UI. Please discuss your thoughts as you work.
Familiarization (1–2 minutes)
Free experimentation with Teleport, Poke UI, and Create is permitted.
Task 1 (≤ 1 minute)
Requirements: Create 2–3 objects → Stack one on top of another (top-to-top) → Resize using the thumbstick
Records: Completed/Incomplete; Duration; Whether Create and Zoom are found without prompts

Task 2 (≤ 1 minute)
Requirements: Select a Cube → Rotate (any corner) → Move to another location → Delete via the top panel
Records: Completed/Incomplete; Duration; Whether Delete is found without prompts
Verbal 2–3 statements of overall experience
Rating (5-point scale): Poke UI usability, Teleport comfort (oral recording in video)

8) Success (Pass/Fail)
The vast majority (≥ 80%) of participants completed both tasks within the time threshold.
The majority (≥ 70%) of participants were able to find the Quick Query function without prompts. Actions/Delete
Subjective scoring meets threshold (see above)
