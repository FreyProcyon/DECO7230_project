#Testing Plan
Testing plan for interactive prototype 1 â€“ Prototype of an XR 3D Modeling Tool
This is an XR prototype of a Rhino-like 3D modeling tool.
Users can free-fly or teleport through the XR environment and use the toolbar to create, select, move, rotate, scale, and delete objects.
The project's goal is to explore how to make traditional CAD/Rhino push-pull modeling more intuitive and efficient through the immersive operation of XR.

Testing Objectives
Confirm that users can intuitively understand and operate the Create (Cube/Sphere/Cylinder/Plane) function.
Verify that users can successfully complete the selection and manipulation (Select + Move/Rotate/Scale/Delete) task flow.
Observe user comfort and preferences under different camera modes (Free-Fly / Step Teleport).
Identify points of confusion in the current interaction design to inform subsequent iterations.

Testing Methodologies
Think-Aloud Protocol: Participants verbalize their thoughts while performing actions, helping researchers understand their cognitive processes.
Task-Based Testing: Assign participants one or two specific tasks, such as "create a cube and place it on top of a sphere," and observe their ability to complete them.
A/B Comparison (optional): Compare the user experience of the Free-Fly and Step Teleport camera modes.

Prototype Description & Requirements
The prototype includes:
Create Function: Places a cube/sphere/cylinder/plane in the scene, with preview and grid snapping.
Select Function: Selects an object and highlights it.
Operation Functions:
Move (two-step placement and movement, grid snapping)
Rotate (drag/scroll wheel)
Scale (drag/scroll wheel, with minimum/maximum constraints)
Delete (multiple selections highlighted in red, Delete All/Cancel)
PushPull (placeholder, to be developed)
Change Material (placeholder, to be developed)
Camera Control: Free-Fly and Step Teleport modes.
The prototype meets the following testing objectives:
Provides sufficient interaction to verify basic modeling workflows.
Provides camera switching to test spatial awareness and comfort.

Data Collection Method
Observation & Notes: Records user behavior, hesitation points, and errors during operation.
Think-Aloud Verbalization: Collect users' intuitive perceptions of the interface and operational thinking.
Success Rate: Count whether a given task (e.g., "Place the cube on top of the sphere") is completed.
Time on Task: Record the time it takes to complete each task.
Subjective Feedback: After the class, ask users about their comfort level, camera mode preferences, etc.

Testing Setup
The Unity prototype has been run on the computer, ensuring that basic Create/Select/Transform/Delete functions function correctly.
The camera switch button and toolbar UI are operational.
Testing Space: Friday Studio Classroom, 5+ participants (classmates/instructors).
Tools: Timer, observation note sheet, feedback questionnaire (optional).

Testing Process
Introduction (30 seconds): Briefly explain that this is a 3D modeled XR prototype and ask participants to try to complete the task.
Familiarization (1 minute): Allow users to freely explore Create and camera movement.
Task 1 (2 minutes): Create a Cube and move it on top of a Sphere.
Task 2 (2 minutes): Scale a Cylinder and rotate it to the desired angle.
Task 3 (optional comparison, 2 minutes): Try performing the same operation in Free-Fly and Step Teleport modes to compare the experience.
Wrap-up (30 seconds): Gather verbal feedback and overall comments.
