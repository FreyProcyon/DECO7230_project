# Prototype 1 - Horizontal Unity Prototype
Testing Plan – XR 3D Modeling Tool
Testing Objective
Evaluate the impact of the floating toolbar position (left/right/front) on user fluency and comfort.
Test the naturalness and accuracy of gestures for pushing and pulling modeling blocks in a VR environment.
Verify whether the fly-view switching function helps users more efficiently inspect large models while reducing nausea.

Testing Methodology
Think-Aloud Protocol: Have participants express their feelings, confusion, and decision-making reasons in real time while using the VR prototype.
Task-Based Testing: Give users two tasks:
Use push-and-pull gestures to adjust blocks to a specified size.
Use fly mode to switch to a bird's-eye view and inspect the model.

Prototype Requirements
Support basic push-and-pull and zoom-and-zoom operations (gesture interaction).
The toolbar position should be switchable (at least two positions).
Provide the ability to switch between fly mode and standard view.
A simple task prompt interface should be provided to guide users through the test tasks.

Data Collection and Success Criteria
Data collected:
Task completion time (seconds)
Number of false touches during gestures
Users' subjective ratings of toolbar location and airplane mode (1–5 points)
Positive/negative feedback from Think-Aloud
Success criteria:
Most users (>70%) were able to complete the task within the allotted time
False touch rate less than 10%
Average user rating of toolbar location and airplane mode ≥ 4/5
No significant interaction issues identified as impeding usability
